constraint differential dynamical programming. 

Reproduce code for the paper Contact-Implicit Differential Dynamic Programming for Model Predictive Control with Relaxed Complementarity Constraints, **Gijeong Kim**, Dongyun Kang, Joon-Ha Kim and Hae-Won Park.

use OSQP (https://osqp.org/docs/index.html) as QP solver

contains example for a double integrator and a 2D car with circular constraint
